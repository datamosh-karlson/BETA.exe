# BETA.exe
heres my first skidded malware that no one will test :)

its poorly made these exe files but here's what you need to do:

1. open the setup on the vm and click on it
2. wait 10 seconds and then open cmd
3. you must do "cd C:\BETA"
4. you need to do "start start.vbs" and then close cmd.
5. thlple is a kiddie

thats it
